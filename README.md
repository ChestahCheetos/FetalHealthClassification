# Fetal Health Classification

This is a jupyter notebook that utilizes classification techniques to identify fetal health as one of three major categories; healthy, suspect, and pathological.  It uses a variety of features, including baseline fetal heart rate, accelerations/sec, fetal movement/sec, uterine contractions/sec, and more.

The purpose of this project was to learn more about leveraging a confusion matrix and classification report to make intelligent decisions on which models fit the problem best.  Additionally, I wanted to see the differences in the model and scoring when using different types of data scaling methods.

The notebook is diveded into sections detailing the actions being taken.

The data is collected from a Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/fetal-health-classification).
