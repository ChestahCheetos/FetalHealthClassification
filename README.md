# Fetal Health Classification

This is a jupyter notebook that utilizes classification techniques to identify fetal health as one of three major categories; healthy, suspect, and pathological.  It uses a variety of features, including baseline fetal heart rate, accelerations/sec, fetal movement/sec, uterine contractions/sec, and more.

The notebook is diveded into sections detailing the actions being taken.  I tried two different methods of scaling the data to see if either method would improve the overall performance of the models.

The data is collected from a Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/fetal-health-classification).
