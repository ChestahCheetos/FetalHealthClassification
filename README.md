# Fetal Health Classification

This is a jupyter notebook that utilizes classification techniques to identify fetal health as one of three major categories; healthy, suspect, and pathological.  It uses a variety of features, including baseline fetal heart rate, accelerations/sec, fetal movement/sec, uterine contractions/sec, and more.

The notebook is diveded into sections detailing the actions being taken.  I tried two different methods of scaling the data to see if either method would improve the overall performance of the models.

The data is collected from a Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/fetal-health-classification).

# Hi, I'm John! ðŸ‘‹


## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a business analyst at a major health insurance organization.  I'm very interested in data science as a tool to turn data into digestable information that people want to learn about.  I've worked in healthcare for over half a decade, but I also hold interests in music, cooking, and housing.

I've been spending the last year and a half learning Python, SQL, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn in my free time to improve my data analysis and data science skills.  While I continue to build those skills, I've been learning recently about Tableau, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.
